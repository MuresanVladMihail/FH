Fizz and Buzz refer to any number that's a multiple of 3 and 5 respectively. In other words, if a number is divisible
by 3, it is substituted with fizz; if a number is divisible by 5, it is substituted with buzz. If a number is simultaneously
a multiple of 3 AND 5, the number is replaced with "fizz buzz." In essence, it emulates the famous children game
"fizz buzz".

    let number = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15];
    # Here 3 is fizz and 5 is buzz
    for (let i = 0; i < len(number); i = i + 1) {
        let n = number[i];
        if (n % 15 == 0) {
            println(n + ' fizz buzz');		
        } elif (n % 3 == 0) {
            println(n + ' fizz');
        } elif (n % 5 == 0) {
            println(n + ' buzz');
        } else {

        }
    }
    println(' '+(bSearch(number, 4)));
