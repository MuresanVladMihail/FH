1) Add function "type" which returns a string with the type of the object - DONE

2) Add #- I'm a multi comment line -# - DONE 

3) Make function "print" print hashtable's content - DONE 

4) Add constant variables. Eg: let A = 42; - DONE 

5) When an error happens be sure it reports the location from where it 
	happened and the function being affected (its location too) - DONE

6) '+' can be used to concatenate strings and strings with numbers - DONE

7) "Hello $a!" where "a" is let a = "Vlad" - NOT sure it's useful anymore

10) Add support for for-loops  - DONE 

11) Add elif  - DONE 

12) Add support for saving variables as integer not only float32/float64

13) Add optional parameters in functions, like C++ does it. - NO 

14) Add "'" token which will be parsed as " " ". - DONE

15) Add support for mutiple variable declarations on the same line using comma to separate them, 
eg: let a = 42, b = 'hi', c = function err() { println ("err"); }; - NO 

16) Add standard math lib - DONE 

17) Add standard I/O lib - almost DONE 

18) Fix this compiler error for continue keyword: 
function main() {
    let i = 0;
    while (i < 4) {
        i = i + 1; # Must be placed at the end or else it won't work!
        if (i == 2) {continue;}
        println(i);
    }
} - DONE

19) Add standard string manipulation library - DONE

20) Add standard OS library - DONE

21) When adding a new c_function you should check if that function was earlier 
added and if it were issue an error. - DONE 

22) Write a PDF describing how to use the language.

23) Add support for do {} while (); - DONE (repeat-until)

24) Add: https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/basics/python-docstrings
which will let us do:

function a(): "This function is used for doing incredible stuff" {
    return 42;
} - DONE

println(get_doc(a)); -> returns the string from above. - DONE
25) Test more the operator '+' with strings, eg: "hello" + "there" - DONE

26) The exception thrown system needs to handle the erors better especially when it comes 
to line numbers. - DONE 

27) Add for maps and vectors a deconstructor callback which is called when the 
	object is about to be deleted?

28) Add a function which returns how much memory has been used by the language 
	(increments when creating objects and substracts when they are deleted)  - DONE

29) Add 'extends' function for maps - DONE

30) Closure creation like this: 
	fn a();
	fn b(z, x, c); should be valid.
 Right now only this is valid: 
	fn a() {};
	fn b(z, x, c) {}; - DONE
