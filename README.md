# FH

FH is designed to be embedded inside native applications (e.g. game engines),
where scripts are sandboxed, deterministic, and tightly integrated with C code.

## Getting Started

### Build

FH is a single C99 codebase with no external runtime dependencies. From the
repo root:

```text
$ make -j2
```

This produces the `fh` interpreter binary in the repo root. See `make check`
(valgrind), `make TARGETS=debug` and `make TARGETS=asan` for other build
modes, and `CLAUDE.md` for the full list of build/test commands.

### Run a script

```text
$ ./fh tests/mandelbrot.fh
```

Run the test suite with `./run_tests.sh` (executes every `tests/test_*.fh`
script through the real interpreter and checks its exit status).

### Embedding FH

FH's whole purpose is to be dropped into a host C/C++ application as a
scripting layer. The public embedding API is [`src/fh.h`](src/fh.h); the
typical pattern is:

```text
fh_init();                                        // once, process-wide
struct fh_program *prog = fh_new_program();
fh_add_c_func(prog, "my_host_func", my_host_func); // expose host functions to scripts
fh_compile_file(prog, "script.fh", true);          // compile a script into prog
struct fh_value ret;
fh_call_function(prog, "main", NULL, 0, &ret);      // call a script function
fh_free_program(prog);                              // tear down
```

`fh_add_c_func`/`fh_add_c_funcs` register C callbacks the script can call;
`fh_compile_file`/`fh_compile_input`/`fh_compile_pack` compile source (from a
file, an in-memory string, or a `.fhpack` archive) into a `fh_program`; and
`fh_call_function` invokes a named script function, passing/returning
`struct fh_value`s. See `src/main.c` for a complete, real usage of this
sequence (it's how the `fh` CLI itself runs scripts).

## Standard Library

FH's built-in functions (`string_*`, `math_*`, `io_*`, `os_*`, `json_*`,
plus core helpers like `len`, `append`, `has`, `type`, `assert`, `error`, and
GC controls) are documented with parameters, return values and examples in
[`docs/doc.mkd`](docs/doc.mkd).

## Features

- compilation to bytecode
- register-based VM.
- simple mark-and-sweep garbage collector
- full closures
- dynamic typing with `null`, `boolean`, `number`, `string`, `array`,
  `map`, `closure` `c_func` and `c user defined objects`
- simple standard library
- simple regex support
- simple tar support
- own packaging format
- hashing algorithms: bcrypt and md5
- uses fast and uniform random generator, mt19937

## Implementation Notes

- register-based virtual machine (fast dispatch with computed goto)
- bytecode compiler with type hints
- compact (~10k lines of C)
- no external runtime dependencies

## Error Reporting

FH provides detailed error messages with full stacktraces:

- **Error location**: File, line, and column number where the error occurred
- **Call stack**: Complete traceback showing the call chain from entry point to error
- **Function names**: Each frame shows which function was executing
- **Call sites**: Line numbers show where each function was called from

Example error output:
```
ERROR: file.fh:5:14: error: division by zero

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "file.fh", line 33, in main
  File "file.fh", line 20, in process_data
  File "file.fh", line 16, in calculate_average
  File "file.fh", line 5, in divide
```

## Example Code

### Closures

```
fn make_counter(num) {
    return {
        "next" : fn() {
            num = num + 1;
        },

        "read" : fn() {
            return num;
        },
    };
}

fn main() {
    let c1 = make_counter(0);
    let c2 = make_counter(10);
    c1.next();
    c2.next();
    printf("%d, %d\n", c1.read(), c2.read());    # prints 1, 11

    c1.next();
    if (c1.read() == 2 && c2.read() == 11) {
        printf("ok!\n");
    } else {
        error("this should not happen");
    }
}
```

A closure returning a map of functions is how FH does objects: the locals it
captures are private state, each call makes an independent instance, and the
methods need no `self`. Section 1.12 of [`docs/doc.mkd`](docs/doc.mkd) covers
the pattern and how to give each object its own file.

### Mandelbrot Set

```
# check point c = (cx, cy) in the complex plane
fn calc_point(cx, cy, max_iter)
{
    # start at the critical point z = (x, y) = 0
    let x = 0;
    let y = 0;

    let i = 0;
    while (i < max_iter) {
        # calculate next iteration: z = z^2 + c
        let t = x*x - y*y + cx;
        y = 2*x*y + cy;
        x = t;

        # stop if |z| > 2
        if (x*x + y*y > 4)
            break;
        i = i + 1;
    }
    return i;
}

fn mandelbrot(x1, y1, x2, y2, size_x, size_y, max_iter)
{
    let step_x = (x2-x1) / (size_x-1);
    let step_y = (y2-y1) / (size_y-1);

    let y = y1;
    while (y <= y2) {
        let x = x1;
        while (x <= x2) {
            let n = calc_point(x, y, max_iter);
            if (n == max_iter)
                printf(".");         # in Mandelbrot set
            else
                printf("%d", n%10);  # outside
            x = x + step_x;
        }
        y = y + step_y;
        printf("\n");
    }
}

fn main()
{
  mandelbrot(-2, -2, 2, 2, 150, 50, 1500);
}
```

### Fibonacci

```
fn fib(n)
{
    if (n >= 2) {
        return fib (n - 1) + fib (n - 2);
    }
    else {
        return n;
    }
}

fn main() {
    printf("%f\n", fib(35));
}
```
